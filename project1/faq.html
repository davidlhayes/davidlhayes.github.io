                <strong>What is this, really?</strong><br>Choose Your Adventure provides high-quality role-play adventures using costumes, sets, technical effects, and technologies in concert with actors and producers dedicated to your ultimate satisfaction.</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Why is it so expensive?</strong>This is not a theme park attraction where we need to serve a large number of people in a day. All of our people and resources are dedicated to you for two or three days. Yes, really.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Can I have a romantic adventure?</strong>If by romantic you mean, flirting, you bet! The role you play will naturally attract the opposite sex. Go with it. It’s just pretend. But flirting is the limit. Suggestive contact, sexual propositions, or assault of any sort will assure that your adventure comes to an abrupt and dramatic end.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Can I change the story?</strong>Mind you, we strive to make events that occur seem authentic, i.e., not planned, but this <em>is</em> an interactive advneture. So, absolutely. Our performers routinely improvise their dialogue and actions in response to what you do and say. Having said that, the world of your adventure has limits and they are dedicated to our established main storylines.

                <strong>What if I find it overwhelming?</strong>Adventurers always have the ability to signal a safety pause. Actors will never stay in character during a safety pause.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>What if I'm a jerk</strong>First of all, there is an interview and screening process to assure that our guests are embarking on one of our adventures in the right spirit. More importantly, we make our expectations very clear and end the adventure if boundaries are not observed. Generally, if you stay in character and use weapons and technology as instructed (essentially, a “pretend mode”), you’ll be fine.
