This Monday to Friday project required at least one page, one Ajax call, media queries to handle at least two breakpoints. Bonus targets included jQuery animation, multiple pages, and use of Sass.

The website offers fantasy adventures, so the landing page is meant to pique curiosity and give just a hint of what an adventure might be like. The nature of the business offering limits the amount of content that will be shown.

Additional pages are FAQ and Legal.
