This Monday to Friday project required at least one page, one Ajax call, media queries to handle at least two breakpoints. Bonus targets included jQuery animation, multiple pages, and use of Sass.

The website offers fantasy adventures, so the landing page is meant to pique curiosity and give just a hint of what an adventure might be like. Users are presented with a rotating cube. The face of the cube that is clicked determines which adventure description fades into view on one side of the page or the other.

The nature of the business offering limits the amount of content that will be shown.

Additional pages are FAQ and Legal.

Technologies used:

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Sass
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Ajax

The Ajax call is employed in the handling of the contact form. A remote server sends e-mail to the address provided on the form when the submit button is clicked.

Responsive design is employed. At a very narrow screen width, the cube is replaced with an array of buttons. Adventure pictures and descriptions appear below the buttons.
