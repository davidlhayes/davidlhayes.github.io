            <p>Choose Your Adventure provides high-risk activities with limited
              safeguards. Customer assumes all risk and acknowledges that such
              activities are all undertaken at the customer’s discretion.
              Anything that is being “done” to the customer can be ended at
              any time with the established SafeWord™ or SafeSignal™.</p>
            <p>Choose Your Adventure actors, sets, vehicles, and technology
              have no special claim to safety. Customer has responsibility
              for judging the opportunities or indicated action with
              regard to his or her own ability. Actors are trained and
              prepared to provide storyline deviations when a suggested
              path appears to be ignored, dismissed, or balked at.</p>
            <p>Adventures that are ended prematurely by customer choice are
              refunded on a pro-rated basis. Adventures that are ended because
               of unacceptable behavior on the part of the client are not
              refundable. Some adventures involve the theft or other
              acquisition of money or treasure. No promise of success is
              made. However, a successful mission may result in the refund of
               some of the customer’s payment for the adventure. This policy is
                subject to change.
