## A Ruby on Sinatra Single Page App ##

## Summary of Project

A friendly RSVP application to solicit commitments for company representatives who might attend a meet-and-hire (reverse job fair). Features my animated signature on a "Hello" sticker.

The animation is done with CSS animation. The signature was captured on a digitizer pad, smoothed by hand, and then converted to discrete curves. On loading, each curve in the set is set to dashed line-type with the dash length the length of the curve and offset past the length of the curve. After a CSS keyframe delay, the offset is transitioned to zero over a designated time interval.
