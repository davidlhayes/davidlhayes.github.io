## A MEAN-stack single-page game app ##

## Summary of Project

Employing Node.js, Express.js, Angular.js, and Firebase in place of MongoDB NoSql data, this game is just what you'd expect if you'd played Stratego. Just for something different, space ship icons and an outer space motif make of the visuals.
