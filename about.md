Hello, I am David Hayes. I'm new to web development, but I've been creating and coding as long as I can remember. In fact, I had a career in coding full-motion flight simulators used for FAA-certified pilot training. Now, I'm focused on the web and applicationsâ€”-creating designs that communicate volumes and persuade fully and solutions that speak to genuine needs.

I'm available now for full-time employment. Does that interest you? Let's talk. E-mail me or call me today! Voice or text: 630-631-8220.
