Hello, I am David Hayes. I live in the Chicago area. I'm a full-stack web developer these days, but I've been creating and coding in some form for as long as I can remember. In fact, I had a career in coding full-motion flight simulators used for FAA-certified pilot training. Now, I'm focused on the web and applicationsâ€”-creating designs that communicate volumes and persuade fully and solutions that speak to genuine needs.

I'm available now for full-time employment. Does that interest you? Let's talk. Why not contact me today?
